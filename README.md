# Assignment: Reactomon

## Description
Create a basic frontend application in React using the Pokemon API.

## Tasks
You have to create a React application for Pokemon API. It should have 3 available routes for listing pokemons, listing types and a detailed view for specific Pokemons.

- create a Navbar component
  - it should contain Links to 2 routes: Pokemons and Types
- create a PokemonList component. It’s a simple component for listing every item on this endpoint
  - it’s available via the Pokemons link in the Navbar on http://localhost:3000/pokemons
- create a TypeList component. It’s a simple component for listing every item on this endpoint
  - it’s available via the Types link in the Navbar on http://localhost:3000/types
- create a PokemonDetail component. It’s a detailed page about a Pokemon’s attributes, for example Bulbasaur
  - these Links are available on the Pokemons page. Every listed Pokemon item should be a Link pointing to detailed pages, like http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1
  - use your imagination!

## Requirements
- the above mentioned components (Navbar, PokemonList, etc.) are just the minimum requirements, your solution is better if you slice your big components into smaller ones
- create a Github repo and commit on every new component you create. It’s even better if you make atomic commits
- use create-react-app
- use axios for fetching data
- use react-router-dom for navigation
